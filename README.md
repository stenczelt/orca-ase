# ORCA interface for ASE

Initial code written by Ragnar Bj√∂rnsson, published here:
https://sites.google.com/site/orcainputlibrary/qm-mm/orca-ase

This repository is an update to that providing some versatility in functionality.

Installation:
1. Place `orca.py` inside the calculators directory of the ASE calculators code (`somewhere/lib/python3.5/site-packages/ase/calculators/`)
2. Place `orca-io.py` inside the io directory of the ASE code (`somewhere/lib/python3.5/site
-packages/ase/io/`). Remember to rename the `orca-io.py` file to `orca.py`
